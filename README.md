# Docker Projects Repository

Welcome to the **Docker Projects Repository**! This repository contains practical projects demonstrating the use of Docker in real-world scenarios. Each project showcases different ways to utilize Docker for application development, deployment, and orchestration.

Explore examples of containerized applications, multi-service setups with Docker Compose, and more, designed to help you implement Docker in your workflows efficiently.


## üöÄ Getting Started with the Projects

Each project is in its own directory with detailed instructions for setup and execution. Follow the provided `README.md` files in each folder to run the projects seamlessly.


## üì¶ What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform that simplifies application deployment by packaging them into lightweight, portable containers. These containers can run consistently across different computing environments, making development, testing, and deployment much smoother.


## üñºÔ∏è Key Concepts

### 1. **Docker Images**
A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run an application (code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files).

- **How to Use**: Images are the blueprint for containers. You can pull images from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) or build your own using a `Dockerfile`.
- **Example Command**:

  ```bash
  docker pull ubuntu:latest
  docker images
  ```

### 2. **Docker Containers**
Containers are runtime instances of Docker images. They are isolated, portable, and ensure your application runs the same everywhere.

- **How to Use**: Use the `docker run` command to create and start a container.
- **Example Command**:

  ```bash
  docker run -it ubuntu bash
  ```


## üåê Docker Hub

[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) is a cloud-based registry for Docker images. You can:

1. Pull pre-built images for various applications.
2. Push your custom-built images for sharing or personal use.

- **Example Command**:
  ```bash
  docker login
  docker push <your-username>/<your-image-name>
  ```


## üï∏Ô∏è Docker Networks

Docker Networking allows containers to communicate with each other, the host system, or external networks.

### Types of Networks:
- **Bridge**: Default network for containers. Suitable for standalone setups.
- **Host**: Shares the host system's network stack.
- **Overlay**: For multi-host communication in Swarm mode.

- **Example Commands**:
  ```bash
  docker network ls  # List networks
  docker network create my_network  # Create a network
  docker run --network=my_network my_container  # Attach container to network
  ```


## üìú Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Example `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  database:
    image: mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
```

### Commands:
- Start all services:
  ```bash
  docker compose up
  ```
- Stop all services:
  ```bash
  docker compose down
  ```
